4) Using Tableau, find the average nightly rental price per property type in each city for all the sample short-term rental properties 
in
the Watershed database that have the same type and location as Watershed’s client’s 244 properties. In which city is the difference 
between average nightly rental prices for houses vs. apartments the greatest?
San Diego, CA X
New York, NY
Miami, FL R
Charleston, SC

Comment:
Great job! This is evidence that there is an interaction between property type and location such that the difference in rental prices
between different property types varies quite a lot in different locations. The rental prices for houses in Chapel Hill are only about
$50 more per night than rental prices for apartments in Chapel Hill, but rental prices for houses in Miami are over $350 more per night
than rental prices for apartments in Miami. This means you will likely want to take into account BOTH property type AND location in 
your analys

5) Are you going to exclude any data points before proceeding to the Excel modeling portion of your project? No
* We just wanted to double-check that you knew not to exclude any data when you do your Excel analyses next week!
