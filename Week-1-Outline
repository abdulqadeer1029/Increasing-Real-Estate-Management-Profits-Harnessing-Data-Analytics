### Preparing for Elicitation

## Elicitation Refresher
Prepare for Elicitation:
1) The first step in requirements elicitation is gleaning a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the project’s business need.
During the elicitation process, an analyst’s strong understanding of the business need will help her guard against scope creep and
gold plating, as well as select the proper stakeholders and elicitation techniques.

2) An analyst’s next step in eliciting requirements is ensuring that an adequate amount and mix of stakeholders are secured for the 
project’s duration. For, as BABOK 2.0 (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge, the definitive guide to all things related to business 
analysis) notes, a good analyst must “actively engage stakeholders in defining requirements.” According to BABOK, a project’s 
stakeholders may include customers/end users, suppliers, the project manager, quality analysis, regulators, project sponsors, 
operational support, domain subject matter experts, and implementation subject matter experts. An analyst must recruit the 
participation of appropriate stakeholders based on the unique business needs of her project. After an analyst has identified and 
recruited her stakeholders, and chosen the method(s) by which she will elicit requirements (outlined below), it is advisable for
her to schedule the time for conducting those methods with stakeholders as far in advance as possible to ensure adequate participation 
on their parts.

## Letter from Your Project Manager
Expand into short-term rental:
Like most traditional property managers, Watershed has thus far exclusively managed long-term leases that typically require tenants to
live in a property for a year or more, and pay monthly rent. However, the real estate business has begun extending into a different 
market: short-term rentals. Short-term tenants, or "guests," pay rent by the night rather than by the month, and are located and 
communicated with through increasingly popular websites like Airbnb. We would like to know whether Watershed should expand into this 
short-term rental market.

Objectives:
(1) calculate how much it would cost to convert and maintain each of this client’s properties as a short-term rental, and 
(2) determine the nightly rental price that would maximize the profits from each of these properties, if they were converted to 
 short-term rentals. We would then like you to use this information to, 
(3) calculate which properties would have increased profits as short-term rentals, and
(4) determine how profitable, overall, it would be if Watershed converted some of this client's properties into short-term rentals.
You will also 
(5) need to determine how much cash Watershed would need in order to realize any potential profits from converting the properties.

Business Recommendation:
Should Watershed enter the short-term rental market using some of this client’s property portfolio, or not? If so, 
which properties should be converted first? You will be presenting your recommendation to Watershed executives in a 5-minute long 
business presentation in the last week of this project.

## Background about the Short-term Rental Industry
Summary: We recommend you read at least some of these resources to help orient you to the motivation and context of your Watershed
project, so that, in the peer review at the end of this lesson, you can list three people you would talk to during Elicitation and a
question you would ask each one of them.

### Elicitation Interviews
Your job this lesson is to listen to the videos of these interviews, and extract the information that will be important for your 
analysis. You will be quizzed at the end of the lesson on the assumptions you should make in your analysis, based on what was said in
these interviews.
