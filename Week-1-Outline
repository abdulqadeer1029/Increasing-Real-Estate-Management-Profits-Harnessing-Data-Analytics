### Preparing for Elicitation



## Letter from Your Project Manager
Expand into short-term rental:
Like most traditional property managers, Watershed has thus far exclusively managed long-term leases that typically require tenants to
live in a property for a year or more, and pay monthly rent. However, the real estate business has begun extending into a different 
market: short-term rentals. Short-term tenants, or "guests," pay rent by the night rather than by the month, and are located and 
communicated with through increasingly popular websites like Airbnb. We would like to know whether Watershed should expand into this 
short-term rental market.

Objectives:
(1) calculate how much it would cost to convert and maintain each of this client’s properties as a short-term rental, and 
(2) determine the nightly rental price that would maximize the profits from each of these properties, if they were converted to 
 short-term rentals. We would then like you to use this information to, 
(3) calculate which properties would have increased profits as short-term rentals, and
(4) determine how profitable, overall, it would be if Watershed converted some of this client's properties into short-term rentals.
You will also 
(5) need to determine how much cash Watershed would need in order to realize any potential profits from converting the properties. 

Business Recommendation:
Should Watershed enter the short-term rental market using some of this client’s property portfolio, or not? If so, 
which properties should be converted first? You will be presenting your recommendation to Watershed executives in a 5-minute long 
business presentation in the last week of this project.

## Background about the Short-term Rental Industry
Summary: We recommend you read at least some of these resources to help orient you to the motivation and context of your Watershed
project, so that, in the peer review at the end of this lesson, you can list three people you would talk to during Elicitation and a
question you would ask each one of them.
