### Preparing for Elicitation

## Elicitation Refresher
Prepare for Elicitation:
1) The first step in requirements elicitation is gleaning a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the project’s business need.
Needs:
Watershed currently has a time-sensitive opportunity to explore the short-term rental market with one of its top property owners, 
who has expressed interest in working with Watershed to convert some of its long-term rental properties to short-term rental properties.

Objectives:
(1) calculate how much it would cost to convert and maintain each of this client’s properties as a short-term rental, and 
(2) determine the nightly rental price that would maximize the profits from each of these properties, if they were converted to 
 short-term rentals. We would then like you to use this information to, 
(3) calculate which properties would have increased profits as short-term rentals, and
(4) determine how profitable, overall, it would be if Watershed converted some of this client's properties into short-term rentals.
You will also 
(5) need to determine how much cash Watershed would need in order to realize any potential profits from converting the properties. 


2) An analyst’s next step in eliciting requirements is ensuring that an adequate amount and mix of stakeholders are secured for the 
project’s duration. For, as BABOK 2.0 (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge, the definitive guide to all things related to business 
analysis) notes, a good analyst must “actively engage stakeholders in defining requirements.”

* Watershed's Project Manager (Inside)
Questions:
1) which customer is interested in short-term rental? How many properties do we rent to this customer?
2) What do you personally consider a success for this project? 
3) What worries do you have in relation to this project?
4) Is there anyone else we need to talk to?
5) How would you like to be involved in user research?  

* Watershed's Marketing Director (inside)
Questions:
1) Do you have any data about what types of rates people currently pay for short term rental properties?
2) How long do guests stay?  
3) the estimated occupancy rate our company is likely to achieve for short-term rentals without any special promotions, as well as 
the estimated occupancy rates with varying degrees of promotions or discounts as a percentage of the daily room rate.
4) Where Watershed plans to enter the short-term rental market, how do prices fluctuate during the different times of the year?
5) Any development plans in the areas where Watershed plans to enter the short-term rental market?  (If there are many new properties 
will be built in the future in certain areas then it's likely the competition on rental market there will get more tough and the prices
for short-term rent will go down.)

* Watershed's Property Management (inside)
1) What are the cost of current maintenance and utility? (e.g. cleaning)
2) What is the estimation of cost for short-term rental? (hiring additional staff or outsourcing hospitality services such as guests'
check-in, doing the laundry and maintaining the toiletries supply.) 
3) How long it would take to convert an apartment to short-term rental?
4) According to you if we step into rental business, properties from which area will be most profitable to us?
5) What's the cost structure (e.g. staff on premises, possibly cost doesn't change, or contractors)?
6) What do you expect from leasing some of your properties on short-term periods?
7) Who would be responsible in purchasing furniture and restocking supplies in the short term rental locations? 
Comment: 
 The property owner is the person who will be most affected by the switch from long term to short term rentals.
 
* Watershed's Financial Director (inside)
Questions: 
1) What is the company's current financial model for the long term rental properties?
2) Will Watershed pay for all the conversion cost of the properties?
3) Is there any regulatory environment surrounding the industry that we should take into consideration?
4) What are you looking forward to see in my presentation?
5) Do Watershed has a plenty cash flow right now for investment
6) What are the depreciation/amortization policy Watershed use right now?
7) Who are our biggest competitors?
8) What has already been decided about the project? (If you know the constraints of the project, it’s easier for you to decide
on how ambitious you can be about research and resulting design changes. )
9) What are the key factors you expect to be taken into considerations when studying and modelling the business opportunities 
in the short-term rental market?
10) What is an acceptable time frame in between converting the long term rentals and realizing profits? 

* Watershed's Investors/owners: (Inside)
1) What's your current liquidity situation (i.e. what's your cash on hand without complicated adjustments)?
This impacts directly feasibility and cost.
2) What's your expected improvement on the current return?This makes sure that the expectations are understood by all parts and 
realistic.
3) Would you vote in favor of the policies launched by management?

* Watershed Chief Legal Officer (Inside)
Any legal constraints that we need to take into account during our analysis?
Comment: There may be legal restrictions that do not allow to lend certain properties in certain areas for short-term or there could be
certain legal risks that we need to be aware of.

* One of Watershed largest clients, this stakeholder is outside of  Watershed.
Questions:
1) Which part of the long-term rent are you ready to pay to Watershed?

* Local government (e.g alderman): Outside
1) what is your perception of short term rentals and do you think they can benefit your area's development? 
2) What rental regulations and restrictions have to be considered?
3) What are the taxes involved in our commerce?
Comment:
Some governments are considering placing fees on Airbnb models similar to a hotel tax.

* Customers:(Outside)
1) Would you rather want a shorter rent in places where Watershed has properties?

## Background about the Short-term Rental Industry
Summary: We recommend you read at least some of these resources to help orient you to the motivation and context of your Watershed
project, so that, in the peer review at the end of this lesson, you can list three people you would talk to during Elicitation and a
question you would ask each one of them.

## Background about the Short-term Rental Industry
* Short-term rentals cost L.A. renters 11 units per day, account for 63 percent of new housing construction:Building a path out of the
housing crisis in Los Angeles is doomed to fail if commercial STR growth continues to undermine new housing construction at these rates.
(LA's lost housing) 

* Short-term rentals spreading to new neighborhoods: It appears growth is occurring in areas not yet saturated with short-term listings.
(LA's lost housing) 

* General background: As for landlords, many prefer to stay away from the headaches of short-term rentals, including juggling bookings 
and frequent maintenance. “There’s just so much management,” said Douglas Wagner, head of brokerage services for Bond New York, who 
noted brokers also earn smaller commissions on short-term leases. (therealdeal.com)

* But a number of landlords and brokers are learning that there’s money to be made by offering a limited number of short-term rentals. 
“There’s such a huge need for it,” said Phil Horigan, a Corcoran Group agent who in 2013 launched Leasebreak.com, a site geared toward
short-term rentals that now has nearly 600 listings. (therealdeal.com)

* Developers are also creeping into the market.

### Elicitation Interviews
Your job this lesson is to listen to the videos of these interviews, and extract the information that will be important for your 
analysis. You will be quizzed at the end of the lesson on the assumptions you should make in your analysis, based on what was said in
these interviews.
