### Preparing for Elicitation

## Elicitation Refresher
Prepare for Elicitation:
1) The first step in requirements elicitation is gleaning a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the project’s business need.
Needs:
Watershed currently has a time-sensitive opportunity to explore the short-term rental market with one of its top property owners, 
who has expressed interest in working with Watershed to convert some of its long-term rental properties to short-term rental properties.

Objectives:
(1) calculate how much it would cost to convert and maintain each of this client’s properties as a short-term rental, and 
(2) determine the nightly rental price that would maximize the profits from each of these properties, if they were converted to 
 short-term rentals. We would then like you to use this information to, 
(3) calculate which properties would have increased profits as short-term rentals, and
(4) determine how profitable, overall, it would be if Watershed converted some of this client's properties into short-term rentals.
You will also 
(5) need to determine how much cash Watershed would need in order to realize any potential profits from converting the properties. 


2) An analyst’s next step in eliciting requirements is ensuring that an adequate amount and mix of stakeholders are secured for the 
project’s duration. For, as BABOK 2.0 (Business Analysis Body of Knowledge, the definitive guide to all things related to business 
analysis) notes, a good analyst must “actively engage stakeholders in defining requirements.”

## Background about the Short-term Rental Industry
Summary: We recommend you read at least some of these resources to help orient you to the motivation and context of your Watershed
project, so that, in the peer review at the end of this lesson, you can list three people you would talk to during Elicitation and a
question you would ask each one of them.

## Background about the Short-term Rental Industry
* Short-term rentals cost L.A. renters 11 units per day, account for 63 percent of new housing construction:Building a path out of the
housing crisis in Los Angeles is doomed to fail if commercial STR growth continues to undermine new housing construction at these rates.
(LA's lost housing) 

* Short-term rentals spreading to new neighborhoods: It appears growth is occurring in areas not yet saturated with short-term listings.
(LA's lost housing) 

* General background: As for landlords, many prefer to stay away from the headaches of short-term rentals, including juggling bookings 
and frequent maintenance. “There’s just so much management,” said Douglas Wagner, head of brokerage services for Bond New York, who 
noted brokers also earn smaller commissions on short-term leases. (therealdeal.com)

* But a number of landlords and brokers are learning that there’s money to be made by offering a limited number of short-term rentals. 
“There’s such a huge need for it,” said Phil Horigan, a Corcoran Group agent who in 2013 launched Leasebreak.com, a site geared toward
short-term rentals that now has nearly 600 listings. (therealdeal.com)

* Developers are also creeping into the market.

### Elicitation Interviews
Your job this lesson is to listen to the videos of these interviews, and extract the information that will be important for your 
analysis. You will be quizzed at the end of the lesson on the assumptions you should make in your analysis, based on what was said in
these interviews.
