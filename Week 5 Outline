### Week 5 Outline
Dynamic: If a property has a profit of this number or higher, it is considered "Profitable" and is included in the list of properties 
being considered. ( The new assumptions that you entered through your parameters.
* Profitability cut- off (Dynamic)

Fixed: Original: $ 6000 (original ilicitation assumptions)
* Profitability cut- off (Fixed)

Then you create a set of binary calculated fields that are going to make a binary output.
* Profitable or Not? (Fixed)
* Profitable or Not? (Variable)

However: Make a Fixed and Variable calculated field for the following measure.
Net Change in Profits, each year thereafter (for next 4 years) (Fixed)
Net Change in Profits, each year thereafter (for next 4 years) (Variable)

### Creating a binary bin

# Dynamic 
If [Yearly Profits (Yr After Conversion) Variable] >=[Profitablilty Cut-off (Dynamic)]
THEN 1
ELSE 0
End

# Fixed
If [Yearly Profits (conversion Yr) Fixed] >=[Profitablilty Cut-off (fixed)]
THEN 1
ELSE 0
End

1# Yearly Profits (Yr After Conversion) Variable

Comment:
Once you have upload the table into Tableau, you want to duplicate all the columns in the "Capstone-Template-Spreadsheets-5-to-6-updated"
workbook. That means columns W to AQ of the "5-Forecast Cash Flow + Profits" worksheet and columns F to I of the "6 - Sorting by
profitability" worksheet.

Parameters: Refer to the "Forecast cash flow + profits" worksheets. The parameters are in column AG.
Capital expenditure
Depreciation in years 
Utility cost every year
Repairs and Replacements after conversion year
Variable cost per guest visit
Average length of guest stay
Transaction rate
Cut-off threshold

You need to create TWO copies for each of those parameters in Tableau, one fixed, on dynamic.

Key points:
(1) you REALLY need to create two versions of each parameter, a fixed version and a dynamic version.
(2) create two versions of each calculated field as well, as version using the fixed parameters, the other version using the dynamic 
parameters. It will not only help you with the table, you need that for the final dashboard that you are presenting to the Watershed
executives as well, so that they can change the parameters and see how the changes will impact cash flows, profits, number of profitable
properties and total cash need for conversion.
