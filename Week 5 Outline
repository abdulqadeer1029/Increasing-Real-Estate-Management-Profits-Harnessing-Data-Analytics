Comment:
Once you have upload the table into Tableau, you want to duplicate all the columns in the "Capstone-Template-Spreadsheets-5-to-6-updated"
workbook. That means columns V to AQ of the "5-Forecast Cash Flow + Profits" worksheet and columns F to I of the "6 - Sorting by
profitability" worksheet.

Measures:
Net Change in Profits, each year thereafter
Net Change in Cash Flow, each year thereafter
Net Change in Profits, conversion year
Net Forecast Change in Cash Flow, conversion year

V to AQ: 
Interim Result 1
Interim Result 2
Interim Result 3
Optimal Rent
Correct Nightly $ Rent, given constraint that rent must be >= 10th percentile
Correct Nightly Rent Normalized to Percentile
Correct Forecast Occupancy Rate 
Forecast ST Annual Revenues Before Transaction Fees
Forecast ST Annual Revenues After Transaction Fees
LT Annual Revenues
Change in Gross Rental Revenue
Variable Costs - Conversion Year and After
New Cash Out,  Conversion year 
New Cash Out - each year thereafter
New Change in Profits, Conversion Year
New Change in Profits, Each Year Thereafter
Net Forecast Change in Cash Flow, Conversion Year 
Net Change in Cash Flow, Each Year Thereafter (for next 4 years) 
Net Change in Profits, Conversion year
Net Change in Profits, each year thereafter (for next 4 years) 

Parameters: Refer to the "Forecast cash flow + profits" worksheets. The parameters are in column AG.
Capital expenditure
Depreciation in years 
Utility cost every year
Repairs and Replacements after conversion year
Variable cost per guest visit
Average length of guest stay
Transaction rate
Cut-off threshold

You need to create TWO copies for each of those parameters in Tableau, one fixed, on dynamic.

Key points:
(1) you REALLY need to create two versions of each parameter, a fixed version and a dynamic version.
(2) create two versions of each calculated field as well, as version using the fixed parameters, the other version using the dynamic 
parameters. It will not only help you with the table, you need that for the final dashboard that you are presenting to the Watershed
executives as well, so that they can change the parameters and see how the changes will impact cash flows, profits, number of profitable
properties and total cash need for conversion.
