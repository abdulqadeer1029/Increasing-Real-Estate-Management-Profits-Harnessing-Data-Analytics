### Week 5 Outline
## Step1 

Measures: Make a bar graph for each
* Yearly'Cash'Flow'(Conversion'Year)
* Yearly'Cash'Flow'(After'Conversion'Year)
* Yearly'Profits"(Conversion"Year)
* Yearly'Profits'(After'Conversion'Year)

Comment:
Once you have upload the table into Tableau, you want to duplicate all the columns in the "Capstone-Template-Spreadsheets-5-to-6-updated"
workbook. That means columns W to AQ of the "5-Forecast Cash Flow + Profits" worksheet and columns F to I of the "6 - Sorting by
profitability" worksheet.

Parameters: Refer to the "Forecast cash flow + profits" worksheets. The parameters are in column AG.
Capital expenditure
Depreciation in years 
Utility cost every year
Repairs and Replacements after conversion year
Variable cost per guest visit
Average length of guest stay
Transaction rate
Cut-off threshold

You need to create TWO copies for each of those parameters in Tableau, one fixed, on dynamic.
