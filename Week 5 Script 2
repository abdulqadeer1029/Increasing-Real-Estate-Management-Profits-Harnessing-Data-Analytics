## How to Get Started Making your Watershed Dashboard
* Create Measures And Parameters (Dynamic & Variable)

Measures:
Net Change in Profits, each year thereafter
Net Change in Cash Flow, each year thereafter
Net Change in Profits, conversion year
Net Forecast Change in Cash Flow, conversion year

Parameters:
Capital expenditure
Depreciation in years 
Utility cost every year
Repairs and Replacements after conversion year
Variable cost per guest visit
Average length of guest stay
Transaction rate
Cut-off threshold

Comment: Do the numbers  depicted in your bar graphs add up to the same aggregate numbers you found in your Excel 
spreadsheet? If not, check all your calculations and parameter values. If so, congratulations, 
most of the hard work is done! You are ready for the next step!

Step 2: You need to create a *binary calculated field. 
Ex. formula 
IF [(Dynamic)Net Change in Profits, each year thereafter (for next 4 years) ]>=[(Dynamic)Profit Cut-off Threshold]
THEN 1
ELSE 0
END

Step 3: Combine the *bar chart that uses the original assumptions with the bar chart that uses dynamic assumptions Lesson 3.
Watch the video Bar in Bar Graphs in Tableau to find out how!
Measures: Make a bar graph for each
* Yearly'Cash'Flow'(Conversion'Year)
* Yearly'Cash'Flow'(After'Conversion'Year)
* Yearly'Profits"(Conversion"Year)
* Yearly'Profits'(After'Conversion'Year)

Step 4: Watch the video *Histograms in Tableau to find out how to make a histogram

Step 5: Incorporate all the graphs you have made into one dashboard that you will use for your sensitivity analysis Lesson 3
